# Word Count Program
## Description
The Word Count Program is a simple C program that reads a text file and counts the frequency of each word within it. It utilizes a hash table data structure for efficient word counting. This README provides an overview of the program and how to use it.

## Features
- Reads a text file and counts the frequency of each word.
- Utilizes a hash table for efficient word counting.
- Converts all words to lowercase for case-insensitive counting.
## Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.
Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Compile the program using your preferred C  compiler:

```bash
gcc main.c -o word_count
```

Run the program with a text file as an argument:

```bash
./word_count input.txt
```

Replace **input.txt** with the path to the text file you want to analyze.

The program will display the word frequency count to the console.

## Usage
The program expects one command-line argument, which is the path to the text file you want to analyze. It will read the file, count the frequency of each word, and display the results on the console.

For example:

```bash
./word_count input.txt
```

### Sample Output
```
Word Count Summary:

Total words: 50
Unique words: 32

Word Frequency:

"this" - 6
"is" - 5
...
```
